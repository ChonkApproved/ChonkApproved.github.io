Back in March 2020, we had just gone into a lockdown in Canada and cancelled all our upcoming travel plans. Since we knew we would be staying put for a while, we decided to call up a local shelter and see if they needed any fosters. It just so happened, that that morning a stray had been captured and needed a foster home asap! We immediately took her in and promptly failed as foster parents as she became a permanent member of our family - her name is Chonkita and the rest is history! We started out making her cardboard houses in our spare time and realised that we loved making them and she loved having her own hang out spot that was just for her. We are now deciding to share our pet homes with you - feel free to browse the site to see some of our products. As we are a small family business just starting out, we have lots of flexibility and are more than happy to customise pet homes for your fur babies - please reach out ifyou are interested and we would love to work with you! :)
